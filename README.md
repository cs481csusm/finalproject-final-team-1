1. **Project Proposal Report**
   - The length of the proposal must be 2 pages.
   - You have to mention the names of the group members. 
   - Explain the major features of your app
2. **Mid-Progress Report** 
   - In mid-progress design, you will submit the rough design of your application.

     - You can show the design(mockup if you have or direct android screenshots) of your project.
     - You can show the navigation of your project for features. 
     - You can show the code you have done so far. 
   - The instructor and your cohorts will give feedback on the project (for 2 minutes). 
   - In summary, each group will have 12 minutes (max) for presentation and feedback. 
4. **Final Presentation (Final week in class)**
   - Prepare slides for a 9 minutes presentation and project/app demo for a 3-minute presentation.  Each member will present for 2 minutes or more. 
   - The presentation contents will be similar to your written report and submitted code. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the challenging part in the presentation and demo your project for 3 minutes out of 12 minutes. 
   - Don’t forget to mention the innovation and merit of your project.
5. **Final written report (Font size: 12,  single line spacing, number of pages: 6 (excluding appendix), One column format )**
   - Summary/Abstract
   - Introduction
   - App description (describe different Features):

   - List of implemented concepts in your project  (e.g., API)
   - A table of group members and their contributions (e.g., API implementation, UI design, writing report, etc.) to the project.
   - Conclusion
   - References.
   - Appendix (All app screenshots)

6. **Peer Evaluation (Individual):** This task should not take more than 10 minutes. Every student MUST complete a peer evaluation survey to get his/her score. The survey link and the submission deadline will be available on the ABET system. It will take only a few minutes to complete this peer evaluation survey. _You will be penalized 5 points if we don't receive your peer evaluation before the deadline. The following indicators will be used in peer evaluation_. 
   - _Listen to other teammates_: Consistently listens and responds to others appropriately
   - _Cooperate in harmony_: Never argues with teammates negatively
   - _Make fair decisions_: Always helps the team to reach a fair decision
   - _Research and gather information_: Collects a great deal of information--all are relevant to the topic
   - _Share information_: Relays all relevant information to teammates
   - _Offer help_: Offers help proactively and all the times when asked
   - _Full Assigned work_: Performs all assigned works
   - _Time management_:  Hands all assignments on time
   - _Contribute to a team meeting_: Gives all-important progress updates and contribute greatly to ideation

1. **Final deliverable** You have to push your final code, video, report, all presentation slides into your group Github repo. You have to submit the ABET peer evaluation.

Your submission will be graded by simply running it and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive **partial** credit.
